# Privacy Policy ‚Äì One Click Cookie Clearer

**Last updated:** 2025-07-23

This extension does not collect, transmit, store, sell, or share any personal data.

## What it does
When you click the icon, it removes cookies (and optionally local/session storage in the ‚Äú+Storage‚Äù version) for the current tab‚Äôs domain. It shows a short toast and may reload the page if you enable that setting.

## Data handling
- No data leaves your browser.
- The only stored value is a single boolean (`autoRefresh`) in Chrome storage.
- No analytics, telemetry, or remote scripts are used.

## Permissions
- `cookies`: enumerate/remove cookies.
- `activeTab` & `scripting`: inject a tiny toast + optional reload into the current tab after a click.
- `storage`: save the auto-refresh preference.
- `<all_urls>`: needed so it can work on any site; nothing runs until you click.
